//Your task is to check wheter a given integer is a perfect power. If it is a perfect power, return a pair m and k with mk = n as a proof. 
//Otherwise return Nothing, Nil, null, NULL, None or your language's equivalent.
//Note: For a perfect power, there might be several pairs. For example 81 = 3^4 = 9^2, so (3,4) and (9,2) are valid solutions. 
//However, the tests take care of this, so if a number is a perfect power, return any pair that proves it.
